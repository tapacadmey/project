        <h1><pre>MY SQL:</pre></h1>
        <h2><pre>
            MySQL is a relational database management system.A relational database stores data in separate tables rather than putting all the data 
            in one big storeroom.The database structure is organized into physical files optimized for speed.<mark>SQL means Structured Query Language. 
            It's a domain specific programming language that helps control and handle relational databases.</mark> <br>
            some main topics:<br>
            
<u>Features of SQL:<br></u>
It offers a wide range of features that enable users to interact with databases effectively.Here are some key features of SQL:

<u>1.Data Querying and Retrieval:<br></u>
SQL's primary function is data retrieval. It allows users to write queries that retrieve specific data from one or multiple tables. 
The SELECT statement, a core SQL feature, enables users to filter, sort, and extract relevant data based on specified conditions.

<u>2.Data Manipulation:<br></u>
SQL facilitates the manipulation of data within databases. Users can insert new records using the INSERT statement, 
update existing records with the UPDATE statement, and remove records using the DELETE statement. These commands ensure efficient data management.

<u>3.Data Definition:<br></u>
SQL provides commands for defining and managing the structure of a database. The CREATE TABLE statement defines tables, specifying columns,
 data types, and constraints. Users can also modify tables using ALTER TABLE and delete tables using DROP TABLE.

<u>4.Data Integrity and Constraints:<br></u>
SQL supports various constraints to maintain data integrity. The UNIQUE constraint ensures the uniqueness of values in a column;
the PRIMARY KEY constraint designates a unique identifier for each record; the FOREIGN KEY constraint establishes relationships between tables, and the NOT NULL constraint enforces non-null values.

<u>5.Data Joins and Relationships:<br></u>
SQL enables users to combine data from multiple tables using JOIN operations. Different types of JOINs, such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN,
RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN, allow users to retrieve related data efficiently. These operations help establish relationships between tables.

<u>6.Aggregation and Grouping:<br></u>
SQL provides aggregate functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, and MAX to perform calculations on data sets. The GROUP BY clause 
groups data based on one or more columns, and the HAVING clause filters grouped data according to specified conditions.

<u>7.Subqueries:<br></u>
Subqueries, known as nested queries, allow users to embed one query within another. This feature is useful for retrieving
data from one table based on conditions derived from another table. Subqueries can be employed in SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
