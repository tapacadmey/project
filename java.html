    <h1><pre>JAVA:</pre></h1>
    <h2><pre>
        <mark>Java is a high-level, general-purpose, object-oriented, and secure programming language</mark> developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, Inc.
        It is formally known as OAK.In 1995, Sun Microsystem changed the name to Java. In 2009, Sun Microsystem takeover by Oracle Corporation.
        <mark>Java is platform independence.</mark>Nowadays mostly demanded course is Java as compared other languages.<br><br>
        Java important Topics:<br><br>
        <u>1.OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System):<br></u>
        Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a 
        methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance
        by providing some concepts:
            <ol><li>Encapsulation</li>
            <li>Inheritence</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
            <li>Abstraction</li>
        </ol>
    <u>2.String:<br></u>
    In Java, string is basically an object that represents sequence of char values. An array of characters works same
    as Java string.It has Mutable and Imutable Strings For example:<br><br>
        <fieldset>
        char[] ch={'j','a','v','a','t','p','o','i','n','t'};  
        String s=new String(ch);  
        </fieldset>
    <u>3.Exception Handling:<br></u>
    Exception is an abnormal condition.Exception is mainly two types Runtime and Exception.The Exception Handling in Java
    is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained.
    The core advantage of exception handling is to maintain the normal flow of the application. An exception normally
    disrupts the normal flow of the application; that is why we need to handle exceptions.<br>
<u>4.Arrays:<br></u>
    Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
    To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets:<br>
    <fieldset>
        int n=scan.nextInt();
        int[]arr=new int[n];
        for( ; ; ) {
            arr[i]=scan.nextInt();
        }
    </fieldset>
